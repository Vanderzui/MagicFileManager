# MagicFileManager
This is my first java project - the web simple file manager application. In this app you can create/delete directories and files; open and edit .txt files; go through directories 
(back/forward); upload or download files; make a note for every file; change language of page.
Technologies I used:  maven for project's build; apache tomcat (servlets and JSP pages);  MySQL DB.
Application is based on the MVC pattern.
